# RAG-system
With OpenAI's pre-trained model gpt-3.5-turbo, the RAG system is built using the "Attention is all you need" paper. 
Here, the Sentence window parser is used to generate the index and Post processors like metadata replacement and re-rank are used while building the query engine.
Using the RAG evaluator pack evaluation metrics like Correctness, Relevnacy, Faithfulness and Context similarity are generated.
Finally, based on the evaluation metrics, the RAG pipeline is tuned until the desired results are obtained.
